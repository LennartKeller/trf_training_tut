# Poutyne

## First impression (is a Pytorch Version of keras.....)
* Seems to be inspired by Keras => very high level
* Wraps model optimizer and callbacks into a custom module
* Needs quite a lot of tweaks to be able to run transformers models
* But these tweaks are straightforward
## Questions

* How can we implement the custom loss
* Saving the model?
* Datappreparation
* Logging
