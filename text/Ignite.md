# Ignite

Framework to train general PyTorch models
Approach kind of similar to PyTorch-Lightning
Relies heavily on Event Handlers to structure the Training
EventHandler invoke callbacks at certain events.

# Impression
* Seems to be closely connected to PyTorch itself (Website is registred as subdomain
* Documentation somewhat sparse
* Concept not as well structured as by the more object oriented frameworks
