* Wraps the model and optimizer
* Contains the loss function and validation metrics
* Models are fitted using the fit method
  * FIT  the data for training und validation
  * FIT => ON DATALOADER
  * FIT => ON TORCH DATASET
  * FIT_GENERATOR => ON A GENERATOR
* PREDICT => RETURNS PREDICTION
* EVALUATE => COMPUTES LOSS AND METRICS FOR THE MODEL WITHOUT BACKPROP


* CAN BE SEEN AS AN EXTENSION OF THE MODEL CLASS
  * IS EQUIPPED WITH THE NEURAL NETWORK, OPTIMIZER, METRICS, AND LOSS FUNCTION
* FOR EACH RUN ADDITIONAL METADATA IS SAVED
* EXPERIMENTS CAN BE COMPARED TO OTHER EXPERIMENTS
* CAN USE LOGGING OUT OF THE BOX
* CAN MONITOR THE PROGRESS => METRIC HAS TO BE CHOSEN 
  * MONITORING ENABLES TO SAVE THE BEST MODEL WITH RESPECT TO THE MONITORED METRIC THROUGH OUT THE TRAINING
* CAN USE PREDEFINED CONFIGURATION PATTERNS VIA THE TASK ARGUMENT => THEY DEFINE THE LOSS FUNCTION AND METRICS 

* TWO TYPES OF METRICS
  * BATCH METRICS: COMPUTED ON EACH BATCH AND AVERAGED AT THE END OF AN EPOCH
  * EPOCH METRICS: METRICS THAT ARE COMPUTED AT THE END OF AN EPOCH AND ONLY
* CAN BE USED TO DEFINE OWN BATCH OR EPOCH METRICS
* ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE PREDEFINED METRICS
  * ACCURACY
  * PRECISION
  * RECALL
  * F1
* ALSO THERE IS A WRAPPER FOR SCIKIT-LEARN METRIC FUNCTIONS


* CALLBACKS CAN BE USED TO MODIFY THE TRANING
* AVAILABLE CALLBACKS FOR
  * LOGGING
    * CSV
    * TENSORBOARD
    * GRADIENT TRACKING
  * SENDING NOTIFICATIONS
  * CHECKPOINTING
  * LR SCHEDULERS

* Factored into an own library: poutyne-transformers
* ADAPTION OF TRANSFORMERS IS SIMPLE
  * MOST WORK HAS TO BE DONE TO CONVERT THE TRANSFORMERS DATAFORMAT TO THE X,Y SCHEME OF POUTYNE
